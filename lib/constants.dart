const instructionDetails = 'You tap on your Frog or Toad to move them. '
    'For the newcomers, it is a very easy concept to grasp. '
    'Toads and Frogs is played on a 1 Ã— n strip of squares. '
    'At any time, each square is either empty or occupied by a single toad or frog. '
    'Although the game may start at any configuration, '
    'it is customary to begin with toads occupying consecutive '
    'squares on the leftmost end and frogs occupying consecutive '
    'squares on the rightmost end of the strip. '
    'On his turn, Left may move a toad one square to the right '
    'if it is empty. Alternatively, if a frog occupies the space '
    'immediately to a toad\'s right, and the space immediately right '
    'of the frog is empty, Left may move the toad into that empty space; '
    'such a move constitutes a "hop". Toads may not hop over more than one frog, '
    'nor are they allowed to hop over another toad. Analogous rules apply for Right: '
    'on a turn, he may move a frog left into a neighboring empty space, '
    'or hop a frog over a single toad into an empty square '
    'immediately to the toad\'s left. As usual, the first player '
    'to be unable to move on his turn loses';
